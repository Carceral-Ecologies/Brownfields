#We start by creating an empty list below. This will become a list prisons, each containing two lists: objects within proximity and the distances of those objects to the prison.

Once we have returned a list of the objects within proximity and their distances, we will append this returned list to the end of the empty list we initialized, and name the returned list with the FID (so that we can reference the prison later).
